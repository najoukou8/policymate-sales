# In all environments, the following files are loaded if they exist,
# the latter taking precedence over the former:
#
#  * .env                contains default values for the environment variables needed by the app
#  * .env.local          uncommitted file with local overrides
#  * .env.$APP_ENV       committed environment-specific defaults
#  * .env.$APP_ENV.local uncommitted environment-specific overrides
#
# Real environment variables win over .env files.
#
# DO NOT DEFINE PRODUCTION SECRETS IN THIS FILE NOR IN ANY OTHER COMMITTED FILES.
# https://symfony.com/doc/current/configuration/secrets.html
#
# Run "composer dump-env prod" to compile .env files for production use (requires symfony/flex >=1.2).

# Why going with mysql and not sqlite?
# SQLite is especially easier to set up as you don't need to install a database server.
# DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///%kernel.project_dir%/var/data_%kernel.environment%.db"

# You should never commit your .env file. Otherwise you risk exposing your database credentials.
# Futhermore, I have a different configuration for my local development environment than yours which
# creates a risk of conflicting changes.
